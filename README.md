# Byte2Byte

Byte2Byte is a web application that allows developers to compare programming languages side-by-side. 
It provides syntax and method comparisons for common programming concepts like loops, conditionals, classes, and more. 
Byte2Byte is designed for learners (like myself), polyglot programmers, and anyone curious about how different languages tackle similar problems.

I am using this project as a means to introduce myself to the C#/.NET ecosystem, utilising languages I am currently already familiar with.
